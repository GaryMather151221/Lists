Objectives
Letâ€™s write three implementations of the list:
*	A singly linked list (each node has a reference to the next node).
*	A doubly linked list (each node has a reference to both the next and previous nodes).
*	Some other implementation of your choosing, except that it should use no references (pointers) to collect nodes together in the list.

- [x] SinglyLinkedList
- [x] DoublyLinkedList
- [x] GaryList

BaseLinkedList - Contains code common to all implementations.

ListTests - Contains the Add/Find/Delete tests from the word document and will run for each List Type.

*I did think about adding some disposal methods but was concerned about missing the point of the test.*
